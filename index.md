# Overview
(An “Overview” which summarizes what the system does and the problems it is intended to solve for the UH Community.)
There are too many cars and too little parking. Many students live far and many drive to school. As a result, there are many cars being driven by individual students and it’s a waste of gas and money as well as leaving no parking spaces for others.

Pool to school allows for students to find other students that live near each other to carpool to school. Moanoa students can login and create a profile to see other students that live within a specified radius and pool to school will match students according to schedule and places they will be at or need to be at or other criterias they specify like interest or classes.

# User Guide
(A “User Guide” section. The user guide should guide the user through all of the currently implemented functionality of the system. The user guide should include up-to-date screen shots with textual descriptions of what the user can accomplish on the page.)
First, when you get to the Pool to School home page, you will be greeted by this page:
