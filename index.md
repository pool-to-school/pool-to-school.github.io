The problem: There are too many cars and too little parking. Many students live far and many drive to school. As a result, there are many cars being driven by individual students and itâ€™s a waste of gas and money as well as leaving no parking spaces for others.

The solution: The (application) allows for students to find other students that live near by and carpool to school. Moanoa students can login and create a profile to see other students that live within a specified radius and (application) will match students according to schedule and places they will be or other criterias they specify like interest or classes.
