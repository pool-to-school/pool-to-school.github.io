There are too many cars and too little parking. Many students live far and many drive to school. As a result, there are many cars being driven by individual students and itâ€™s a waste of gas and money as well as leaving no parking spaces for others.

Pool to school allows for studentsto find other students that live near each other to carpool to school. Moanoa students can login and create a profile to see other students that live within a specified radius and pool to school will match students according to schedule and places they will be or other criterias they specify like interest or classes.
