# Overview
There are too many cars and too little parking. Many students live far and many drive to school. As a result, there are many cars being driven by individual students and itâ€™s a waste of gas and money as well as leaving no parking spaces for others.

Pool to school allows for students to find other students that live near each other to carpool to school. Moanoa students can login and create a profile to see other students that live within a specified radius and pool to school will match students according to schedule and places they will be at or need to be at or other criterias they specify like interest or classes.

# User Guide

# Community Feedback
Through some constructive criticism from our peers, we have realized some pros and cons about our application:

**Pros:**
- It's a neat idea that we have taken into consideration interest so that you wouldn't be sitting in a car with a stranger that you don't know
- The layout is very simple and intuitive to use, it's pretty self explanatory
- It's good to be able to see the schedule and who have the same thing and you get to choose who you ride with

**Cons:**
- Even though it is self explanatory, a little bit more word description would be helpful
- On the carpool schedule page it's a little confusing as to what is going on
- There should be a page where one can see their profile so they know what other people are looking at too
